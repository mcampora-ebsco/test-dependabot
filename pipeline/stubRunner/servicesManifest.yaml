# This file defines the service dependencies which you need stubbed out during perf testing.
# File uses outdated contract tests and is required for pipeline build.
# It consists of a map of ServiceDependencies. Each service dependency is defined with the data needed to run the stub. 
# The pipeline is responsible for pulling and running the stubs, and will provide the URL for each stub via an environment variable named `${EnvHostVar}`
